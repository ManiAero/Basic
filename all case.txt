Hello Divya,

Hope you are doing well and safe!

Thank you for contacting Ranorex Support. I will be happy to assist you!

1) In this issue, I suggest to re-track the problematic element and verify the issue.

2) As well, you can try to add some delay before action.

3) Also, make sure there is no dynamic value used in RXPath of the element.

If the issue persist,  I would suggest to provide the snapshot of the problematic element.

Hope these details will help you and looking forward to your reply.

Hello Moritz,

Hope you are doing well and safe!

Thank you for contacting Ranorex and I will be happy to help you with this issue.

As per the details provided by you, it seems that when the Aqua desktop client, Ranorex, and the Aqua Ranorex client are on the same server, it works properly.  So we can assume that there are some configurations/settings missing.

Here, I would suggest making sure that all servers and client machines are in the same network as well as access to each other.

As well, make sure no required port is blocked by a security tool (your IT Team can help you with this issue). 

If the issue persists, I would suggest revisiting the Aqua and Ranorex integration document provided by Aqua.

Also, it seems that issue with the Aqua configuration, I would suggest checking with Aqua Support. Team. 

Hope these details will help you.

Thank you for contacting Ranorex Support. I will be more than happy to assist you with this issue.

Here, I would suggest making sure that Firewall or any security tools is not blocking the port as well as not blocking Ranorex/Ranorex Agent.Your IT Team may help you to change ICP Port.

As well, to change Ranorex Agent, make sure you are following below steps:

You can change the port of Ranorex Agent by editing the config.toml file. Refer to the following screenshot for more details:

Before the above changes, make sure:
1) The new port is free in your network and not used by another application/service.
2) Open the new port in the firewall.
3) Open the config.toml file using notepad and change the port.

Hello Rakesh,

Sure we can schedule the meeting, Before that kindly try the following

This may be an installation error. you can try the same scenario on another machine by installing the latest trial version of Ranorex. if it works without issues then you can reinstall or else you can upgrade to the latest version.

You can download the latest version of Ranorex from the following location:

https://www.ranorex.com/download-archive/


If the issue persists provide the AUT details like the Technology of the application, its version, and framework (if any).

It will be much better if you provide demo access to your application to do the possible workarounds.

Let me know your availability (with time zone), and I will schedule a remote session at a time we both have availability.

Hello Ali Ibrahim,

I hope you're having a great week!

	1. Did GDI raw text recognition for this UI element work in previous versions of Ranorex?

	2. This is likely a permission related issue since it worked in previous versions of Ranorex. Try the following and see if there is any improvement:

	3. Run Ranorex and your application under test with administrative rights

	4. Disabled Windows UAC

	5. Ensure Ranorex is whitelisted in any installed antivirus software

	6. Ensure Ranorex, your Ranorex Test, and your application under test are all stored on a local non-encrypted drive (no network drives)

If you continue to experience issues, try the other available WPF plugins (WpfOnly & WpfImprovedOnly) and see if you get better object recognition. I highly recommend checking out the below links for more information on the different WPF plugins. Be aware, changing the WPF plugin may break your existing repository objects.

	!. Settings Overview

	!. WPFImproved User guide

	!. WPFImproved FAQ

	7. As well, you can check this scenario on some another machine with same configuration and environment.

	8. In case, issue persists please provide the Ranorex solution to us for further investigation


	I hope this helps!

To get the list of Smart Folders from the Test Suite, you can use the following code snippet:



TestSuite tS = (TestSuite)TestSuite.Current; 
            IList<TestSuiteEntry> ss =tS.GetAllTestSuiteEntries();
    
            string smartfoldername="";
            foreach(TestSuiteEntry x in ss)
             {
                 if((x.GetType()== typeof(SmartFolderNode) ))
                    {
                      
                      smartfoldername=smartfoldername+ " " + x.DisplayName;
                      //Your Logic
                    }
             }
            Report.Log(ReportLevel.Info, "This is list:" + smartfoldername);

You may need to modify the above code as per your requirements.

Hello Reehan,

Hope you are doing well and safe!

Thank you for contacting Ranorex Support. I will be more than happy to help you today.

I’m afraid that there is no out-of-the-box solution for adding breakpoints and running executables in "debug"-mode from the command line interface. You may try a command-line debugger such as MDbg, which is part of the .NET Framework. For more details about this, refer to the following link:

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/tools/mdbg-exe?redirectedfrom=MSDN

Also, you can refer to the following link:

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/452109/how-to-enter-debug-in-the-command-prompt

Hope these details will help you.

Hi,

It sounds like a problem with project/Ranorex studio configuration? Have you tried to create a new solution with breakpoints? If they works in new solution, try to simulate the situation from your old solution.

At first, copy all settings (both Ranorex studio settings and project settings), from old solution to new one. If the breakpoints still work in new solution, try to add the user code from the non-working project.

BTW, have you tried to debug the solution on another machine? Try also uninstall and re-install Ranorex.

Hello Schaeffling,

I hope you’re having a good week!

To fix this, You have to click TestProject's references, right clicked the Project1 reference, and opened up its properties, and then set "Copy Local" to "False". Also, make sure that the reference's "Path" property was the same as Project1's build path.

May I know if this issue is coming after any updation of the Ranorex version or If you are using the Ranorex agent to execute the solution Remotely

Kindly provide me the Ranorex log file, Also I would suggest verifying this scenario on Another machine

Hope these details will help you and looking forward to your reply.

Hello Michael,

Make sure that disable bounds warnings is True in the properties section. As well as set the action spot value as a Center rather than any other like center left, center right. Kindly refer to the below screenshot


Kindly compress the test case as a zip format and rename it to the case number. Then upload it to the following location. We couldn't find the test case you have already uploaded. 

https://upload.ranorex.com/s/4Epy8GC5RwJa9rT

Also, you have created another ticket(00983611). Can you confirm if this ticket is also pointing same issue i.e clicking on wrong element or clicking on wrong spot.

Hello Martin,

We had a high number of cases recently, and had our team re-arranged, so sometimes cases take a bit longer to investigate.

Can you let me know if the error you experienced is reproducible, and if so send us over some more details and I will look into it further.

Hello Reehan,

I hope you’re having a good week!

As you said that you need to add the breakpoints in the command line, Regarding this I need to contact the development team and let you know how to overcome this.

Hello Sidney,

I don't think this issue is about the DELL machine but looks like a machine-specific issue.

Hello Shilpa,

Thank you for being a valued customer. 
Hello Tobias,

Hope you are doing well and safe!

Its nice to know that your issue got resolved.

For new issue, I would suggest to check following details:

The Ranorex repository reuses element definitions as long as their RxPath stays the same
The path may change, for instance, if the text of a button element changes
I assume that something in your application changes, e.g. the title of the treeview, when you add a new user.
Please, inspect the paths of the elements that cannot be found and try to change the paths so that they do not depend on information in your GUI that changes after adding a user.

In case issue persists even after above suggestion, I would suggest to create new ticket for the dedicated support for this issue.

Hello Todd,

Hoping you are doing well!!

It seems that the file is not uploaded completely, We can't unzip the file that you are provided

I would suggest trying the solution to disable the SAP plugin when the window is in the background and not used and activate it when it is needed.

Try the following method to resolve it,

"Ranorex.Plugin.SapFlavor.Instance.Enabled = false/true;"

If this setting doesn't work for you then I will happily schedule a meeting.

Hello Tobias,

Hoping you are doing good and safe!

Thank you for contacting Ranorex Support. I will be happy to assist you.

It is possible to copy a test suite from another solution or a test case (or cases) from the test suite of one solution to another. But it doesn't copy the data connectors, so your bindings will be cleared. It may affect the integrity of your solution. It also doesn't keep both updated if you make changes to one or the other. 

You can refer to the following link for more details on managing Test Suites:

https://www.ranorex.com/help/latest/ranorex-studio-fundamentals/test-suite/multiple-testsuites/

It is possible to add existing Recording Modules and Code Modules to another project.
This can be done by performing the following steps:
Right Click on your project in the Projects View
Select “Add Existing Item”
Choose a Recording Module or a Code Module from another Solution.
In the following dialog, you can choose how to resolve the missing repository reference


Confirm this dialog with OK
In the case of a repository, you can merge your repositories into one repository. Do that with Copy&Paste or Drag&Drop - simply copy the elements (e.g. the root nodes) from one repository and paste them into the other repository or drag the elements from one repository to the other repository and drop them there.

It is also possible to use separate repositories. Within your recording module, you can select one which should be used for the recording module.

Please let us know if you need further assistance, I will be happy to help you!

Hello Igor,

Thank you for contacting Ranorex Support. I will be more than happy to assist you with this today.

1. When you upgrade Ranorex on your computer, then the referenced DLLs on your computer will get upgraded. However, your project will still reference 10.1.5 DLLs. You need to re-build the project and this should resolve the issue.

2. This can also be due to dependencies, so you can just restore packages if the above option doesn't help.
Open your solution and in the left project explorer right click on References -> Restore packages.
3. If none of the above options work, I would suggest you do a clean installation (uninstall-restart-install) and see if it works.

I hope this helps. Let me know if you still face any issues and I will guide you further.

Issue 1.1:

I'm afraid that there is no option to set Data Source at the Test Suite level.

Issue 1.2;

If you are using the Ranorex data connector then you can refresh the data connector by default refresh data.

You can refer to the below forum link for more information:

https://www.ranorex.info/update-csv-data-source-at-runtime-t16046.html

Issue 2;

In any case, it is necessary to have a realized and active/unlocked session for being able to execute the Ranorex tests. Ranorex requires an active session throughout the whole test run, so any disconnects, interruptions, minimize, or changes to the session can cause test runs to fail.

Hello Michael,

Hope you are doing well,

In this case, I would suggest that the XPath is not unique and the same xpath applies to multiple elements. Hence the validation picks the first found element. Or due to the lack of unique attributes, there are used element indexes in the path, which are not persistent and so the found element (for a given index) could be different with each run?

What you need to do is to add some additional attributes to the path, which would make the path unique.

Also, I will attach the Userguide link below for the RXpath editor

Dev team is suggesting to try with manual setting following methods

AUT should not be instrumented with auto-detect settings. Instrument it with "Manually configure the parameters" and "Avoid resources decompiling" set to false.
If application crashes upon start, customer/support should try to automate it with Manually configure the parameters. Usually, avoiding to decompile the AUT's resources is causing that application to not compile correctly again. There is also other options which can be altered to see if something can help. For developers, first thing is to use apktool and manually compile and decompile AUT and deploy it without instrumentation. If the AUT crashes then it is not suitable to be decompiled and compiled again (which is mandatory to inject code for automation).

Hello Rachel,

In this issue could you please reinstall Ranorex once again, I would suggest downloading the Ranorex setup for version 10.5.3 from the following link:

Steps to reinstall:

1) Uninstall Ranorex
2) Reboot the Machine
3) Install Prerequisite.exe from the zip
4) Install Ranorex setup

Also, We suggest that there must be installed MSBuild 16 or lower.

Here you can find the details about the offline installer for MS build 16

Along with this if there is any antivirus/firewall installed on the target machine then make sure you have added Ranorex to the exception list of antivirus/firewall.

Hello Motomu,

Hope you are doing well and safe!

Thank you for contacting Ranorex and I will be happy to help you with this issue.

	On a remote machine running a Ranorex Agent, the firewall must be configured to allow access to TCP port 8081 and UDP ports 10000-10001.
	If any other application uses the default port 8081 then Ranorex couldn’t access that post. Please try changing the Ranorex port from 8081 to something else. You can find the “config.toml” file in your Ranorex agent folder.  
	Run Ranorex-agent and the application under test with administrative privileges - https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-run-an-app-as-administrator-in-windows-10
	Disabled Windows UAC - https://articulate.com/support/article/how-to-turn-user-account-control-on-or-off-in-windows-10
	Ensure Ranorex, the Ranorex Solution, and the application under test are stored on a local, non-encrypted drive (no network drives).
	Temporarily disable any anti-virus software and security policies.

I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any further queries.
