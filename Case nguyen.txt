Hello Ali Ibrahim,

I hope you're having a great week!

	1. Did GDI raw text recognition for this UI element work in previous versions of Ranorex?

	2. This is likely a permission related issue since it worked in previous versions of Ranorex. Try the following and see if there is any improvement:

	3. Run Ranorex and your application under test with administrative rights

	4. Disabled Windows UAC

	5. Ensure Ranorex is whitelisted in any installed antivirus software

	6. Ensure Ranorex, your Ranorex Test, and your application under test are all stored on a local non-encrypted drive (no network drives)

If you continue to experience issues, try the other available WPF plugins (WpfOnly & WpfImprovedOnly) and see if you get better object recognition. I highly recommend checking out the below links for more information on the different WPF plugins. Be aware, changing the WPF plugin may break your existing repository objects.

	7. As well, you can check this scenario on some another machine with same configuration and environment.

	8. In case, issue persists please provide the Ranorex solution to us for further investigation


	I hope this helps!
