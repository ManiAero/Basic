Hello Reehan,

Hope you are doing well and safe!

Thank you for contacting Ranorex Support. I will be more than happy to help you today.

Iâ€™m afraid that there is no out-of-the-box solution for adding breakpoints and running executables in "debug"-mode from the command line interface. You may try a command-line debugger such as MDbg, which is part of the .NET Framework. For more details about this, refer to the following link:

Also, you can refer to the following link:

Hope these details will help you.
