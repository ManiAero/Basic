Hello Divya,

Hope you are doing well and safe!

Thank you for contacting Ranorex Support. I will be happy to assist you!

1) In this issue, I suggest to re-track the problematic element and verify the issue.

2) As well, you can try to add some delay before action.

3) Also, make sure there is no dynamic value used in RXPath of the element.

If the issue persist,  I would suggest to provide the snapshot of the problematic element.

Hope these details will help you and looking forward to your reply.


Regards,
Chandravadan Patil,
