Hello Igor,

Thank you for contacting Ranorex Support. I will be more than happy to assist you with this today.

1. When you upgrade Ranorex on your computer, then the referenced DLLs on your computer will get upgraded. However, your project will still reference 10.1.5 DLLs. You need to re-build the project and this should resolve the issue.

2. This can also be due to dependencies, so you can just restore packages if the above option doesn't help.
Open your solution and in the left project explorer right click on References -> Restore packages.
3. If none of the above options work, I would suggest you do a clean installation (uninstall-restart-install) and see if it works.

I hope this helps. Let me know if you still face any issues and I will guide you further.
