Hello Motomu,

Hope you are doing well and safe!

Thank you for contacting Ranorex Support. I will be more than happy to help you.

To get the list of Smart Folders from the Test Suite, you can use the following code snippet:



TestSuite tS = (TestSuite)TestSuite.Current; 
            IList<TestSuiteEntry> ss =tS.GetAllTestSuiteEntries();
    
            string smartfoldername="";
            foreach(TestSuiteEntry x in ss)
             {
                 if((x.GetType()== typeof(SmartFolderNode) ))
                    {
                      
                      smartfoldername=smartfoldername+ " " + x.DisplayName;
                      //Your Logic
                    }
             }
            Report.Log(ReportLevel.Info, "This is list:" + smartfoldername);

You may need to modify the above code as per your requirements.

Hope these details will help you and looking forward to your reply.
