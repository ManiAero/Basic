Hello Todd,

Hoping you are doing well!!

It seems that the file is not uploaded completely, We can't unzip the file that you are provided

I would suggest trying the solution to disable the SAP plugin when the window is in the background and not used and activate it when it is needed.

Try the following method to resolve it,

"Ranorex.Plugin.SapFlavor.Instance.Enabled = false/true;"

If this setting doesn't work for you then I will happily schedule a meeting.

Regards,
