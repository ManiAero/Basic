Hello Sidney,

Hoping you are doing well and safe!

I don't think this issue is about the DELL machine but looks like a machine-specific issue.

In this case, I would suggest verifying this scenario on another machine with the same configuration and environment(possibly on a DELL machine).

If the issue persists, please provide the sample application to us for further investigation.

You can upload a sample application to the following location:

Looking forward to your reply.
